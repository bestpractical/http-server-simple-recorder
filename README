HTTP-Server-Simple-Recorder version 0.0.1

This module allows you to record all HTTP communication between an 
L<HTTP::Server::Simple>-derived server and its clients.  It is a mixin, so 
it doesn't itself subclass L<HTTP::Server::Simple>; you need to subclass from
both L<HTTP::Server::Simple::Recorder> and an actual L<HTTP::Server::Simple> subclass,
and L<HTTP::Server::Simple::Recorder> should be listed first.

Every time a client connects to your server, this module will open a pair of files and log
the communication between the file and server to these files.  Each connection gets a serial
number starting at 1.  The filename used is C<<$self->recorder_prefix>>, then a period,
then the connection serial number, then a period, then either "in" or "out".  
C<recorder_prefix> defaults to C</tmp/http-server-simple-recorder>, but you can override that
in your subclass.  For example, you might want to include the process ID.
